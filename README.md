## Description

This week's activity aims to create a random and secure password to protect sensitive data. We are aware that most data are protected with passwords and the stronger a password character can be, the better it is. So in this exercise, I worked to provide some great content of random passwords.  When we use either numbers, special characters, or letters, the algorithm generates a password with all the characters with the length you chose.
